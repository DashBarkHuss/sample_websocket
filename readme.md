This is a simple WebSocket example that uses the node module `ws`.

While on index.html in Visual Studios Code, run a live server. Then run `node socket-server.js` in the terminal to run the WebSocket. The websocket runs on a separate server and on the 'ws' protocol instead of 'http'.

When you go to index.html on the live server and refresh, in the console you'll see messages sent from the server.
